## SITE NAVIGATION
## By default, all pages in your site are added to navigation.
## If you want to link only specific pages in your header, uncomment
## the list below and for each page you want in navigation, add only the
## (source) path and filename in the order they should show up in navigation.
##
## Note: This file uses the naming scheme site.header_pages from jekyll default
## theme 'minima'.  The naming scheme sucks.  :wink2:
##
## Uncoment below to override 'header_pages' in '_config.yml'
