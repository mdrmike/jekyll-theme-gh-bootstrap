## EXAMPLE DOCUMENT FRONTMATTER

## author: "Full Author Name"
## authors: ["author_name", "Full Author Name", "foo", "handle", "etc"]
## # Pro-tip: If authors is present in the document's front matter as an array
## #   (and author is not), the plugin will use the first author listed,
## #   as Twitter supports only one author.
